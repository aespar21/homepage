BAS version 1.2.0 was released on CRAN today.  This version corrects a
bug that would lead to corruption of data using the byte
compiler; we recommend that all users upgrade as soon as possible.

Other features include using BAS in simple linear regression, to
obtain BF or posterior probabilities for multiple one dimensional
tests.
