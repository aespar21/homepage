`BAS` version 1.3.0 is being released for the launch of our
[Cousera Bayesian Statistics](https://www.coursera.org/learn/bayesian/),
part of the Statistics with R
specialization. New features include  <!--excerpt-->
a long awaited vignette with with an exampled carried out illustrating
the functions, and major updates to the `predict` and `fitted`
functions, such as identification of the "best predictive model", the 
model that is closest to model averaging for prediction, standard
deviations for fitted values and predictions, as well as credible
intervals using the new `confint` function, based on S3 methods and
plots for fitted and predicted values as well as coefficients.




{% highlight R %}
data(Hald)
hald.ZS = bas.lm(Y ~ ., data=Hald, prior="ZS-null", modelprior=uniform())
plot(confint(coef(hald.ZS),parm=2:5))
plot(confint(predict(hald.ZS, se.fit=TRUE), parm="mean"))
{% endhighlight %}
