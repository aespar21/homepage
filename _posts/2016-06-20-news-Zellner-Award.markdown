At the International Society for
Bayesian Analysis 2016 World Meeting in Sardinia, Italy, Merlise Clyde
was presented with the Zellner Medal for her outstanding
contributions, sustained impact and legacy in ISBA leadership; and in
recognition of her career impact in development of Bayesian analysis
as a research, educational and professional leader.

The Zellner Medal honors Arnold Zellner, one of the founders of ISBA
and ISBAâ€™s first president. The purpose of the Zellner Medal is to
recognize ISBA members who have rendered exceptional and distinguished
service to ISBA over an extended period of time, and whose
contributions have had an impact on the society beyond the time of his
or her incumbency.
