BAS version 1.1.0 introduces a truncated Beta-Binomial Prior
distribution on the number of predictors included in a model, <!--excerpt--> which is
useful for the $$p > n$$ case.  This
corresponds to a Bernoulli prior on the inclusion indicators $$\gamma_j$$ with a
common parameter inclusion probability $$\pi$$, and in turn $$\pi$$ is
assigned a Beta prior distribution with parameters $$a$$ and $$b$$,
$$\pi \sim B(a,b)$$. The truncated point $$T$$ is
so that $$P(\sum_j \gamma_j > T) = 0$$ .




For the example, below the number of predictors is constrained to be
less than or equal to 8.

{% highlight R %}
library(MASS)
library(MASS)
data(UScrime)
UScrime[,-2] = log(UScrime[,-2])
crime.bic =  bas.lm(y ~ ., data=UScrime, n.models=2^15, prior="BIC",
                     modelprior=tr.beta.binomial(1,1,8),
                     initprobs= "eplogp")
plot(crime.bic$size, crime.bic$postprobs)
{% endhighlight %}

The default method for sampling in "BAS" enumerates all models so that
models with size > 8 have zero probability in the above example.
Alternatively, we can use the method="MCMC" to avoid sampling models with
prior probability 0.
{% highlight R %}
crime.bic =  bas.lm(y ~ ., data=UScrime, n.models=2^15, prior="BIC",
                     modelprior=tr.beta.binomial(1,1,8),
                     method="MCMC", MCMC.iterations=25000)
plot(crime.bic$size, crime.bic$postprobs)
{% endhighlight %}
